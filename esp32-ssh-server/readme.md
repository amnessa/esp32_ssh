### **Core Concepts**

Before diving into the code, let's understand the basic workflow:

1.  **Initialization**: You'll start by including the necessary libraries and initializing the SSH server.
2.  **Server Configuration**: This involves setting up the server's parameters, such as the port to listen on and the host keys.
3.  **Client Connection Handling**: Your server will need to listen for incoming client connections.
4.  **Authentication**: For each connection, you'll need to authenticate the user. The `LibSSH-ESP32` library supports both key-based and password-based authentication.
5.  **Session Management**: Once a user is authenticated, you can create a shell session to allow them to execute commands.

### **Setting Up Your SSH Server**

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide with a code example to get you started. This example demonstrates a basic SSH server that allows a user to connect with a username and password.

#### **1. Prerequisites**

  * You have the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO set up for ESP32 development.
  * You have installed the `LibSSH-ESP32` library. You can typically do this through the Arduino Library Manager or by adding it to your `platformio.ini` file.

#### **2. The Code**

This code sets up a simple SSH server that prints any command it receives to the serial monitor.

```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <libssh_esp32.h>

// --- WiFi Credentials ---
const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";

// --- SSH Server Configuration ---
const char* ssh_user = "esp32";
const char* ssh_password = "mypassword";

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);

  // Connect to Wi-Fi
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(1000);
    Serial.println("Connecting to WiFi...");
  }
  Serial.println("Connected to WiFi");
  Serial.print("IP Address: ");
  Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());

  // Initialize the SSH server
  if (libssh_begin()) {
    Serial.println("SSH Server Initialized");
  } else {
    Serial.println("Error initializing SSH server");
    return;
  }

  // Set up the SSH server
  ssh_server_set_auth_password(ssh_user, ssh_password);
  ssh_server_begin();
  Serial.println("SSH Server Started. Awaiting connections...");
}

void loop() {
  // The SSH server runs in the background.
  // You can add other tasks to your loop if needed.
  delay(1000);

  // Example of handling an incoming command
  if (ssh_server_has_client_command()) {
    String command = ssh_server_get_client_command();
    Serial.print("Received command: ");
    Serial.println(command);

    // You can process the command here and send a response
    // For example, echoing the command back to the client:
    ssh_server_write_client(command.c_str());
    ssh_server_write_client("\n");
  }
}
```

### **How It Works**

  * **`#include <libssh_esp32.h>`**: This line includes the necessary library for the SSH server functionality.
  * **`libssh_begin()`**: This function initializes the underlying `libssh` library.
  * **`ssh_server_set_auth_password(ssh_user, ssh_password)`**: This is the key function for enabling password authentication. You provide the username and password that the server will accept.
  * **`ssh_server_begin()`**: This starts the SSH server, making it ready to accept client connections.
  * **`ssh_server_has_client_command()` and `ssh_server_get_client_command()`**: These functions are used within the `loop()` to check for and retrieve commands sent by a connected SSH client.
  * **`ssh_server_write_client()`**: This function allows you to send data back to the connected SSH client.

### **Connecting to Your ESP32 SSH Server**

Once your ESP32 is running this code, you can connect to it from a computer on the same Wi-Fi network using any standard SSH client.

On Linux or macOS, you can use the terminal:

```bash
ssh esp32@<YOUR_ESP32_IP_ADDRESS>
```

Replace `<YOUR_ESP32_IP_ADDRESS>` with the IP address printed to the serial monitor when the ESP32 connects to your Wi-Fi.

When prompted for a password, enter the one you set in the `ssh_password` variable (in this example, "mypassword").

After you've connected, you can type commands in your terminal, and you should see them being printed in the Arduino IDE's serial monitor.

This example provides a solid foundation. You can expand upon it to create more complex interactions, such as controlling GPIO pins, reading sensor data, or triggering other actions on your ESP32 via SSH.
